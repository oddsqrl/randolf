## general
<h4 style="color: rgb(132, 168, 192);">Concept</h4>

You play from a dogs point of view. A roomba takes over an old style vacuum cleaner and begins chasing you. There is only one way out of the building to safety and there are various hurdles in the way.

You die on collision with the vacuum cleaner, got a limited amount of boost which slowly regenerates after not using it. Got a few physics objects you can push through for shortcuts but it's not necessary to do so.

The story is that you and your family moved into a new house, with a haunted roomba that has taken control of a vacuum cleaner. You are not brave, you are just scared and bail out. But it seems to be following you?

**Objective**: Get out of the level and into the next level.  
**Rewards**: Level completion.  
**Difficulty**: normal, one level.  
**Scoring system**: Based on either speed of level completion (time trial) and/or level completion.  

**Revenue-model**: Free, Donations.  
**Advertising**: None, face-to-face.  

**Conflict**: Getting stuck on map, nearing vacuum cleaner, finding the right path.  
**Outcomes**: Survival basis.  
**Interaction**: Players can interact with physics objects and gates (such as doors and fence gates)

<h4 style="color: rgb(132, 168, 192);">Rules</h4>

- Can't go through map.
- Can push physics objects.
- Can jump onto platforms.
- Follow an unclear path with a few shortcuts.

<br>

<h4 style="color: rgb(132, 168, 192);">Frameworks</h4>
Unity (C#).
<br>

<h4 style="color: rgb(132, 168, 192);">Requirements</h4>
installation on the PC.

## MDA:
**Aesthetics:**
- Challenge.
- Submission .
- Discovery.

**Dynamics:**  
Challenge: Against other players and working with what you get.  
Submission: It is a game for hectic chaos which is meant to be fun. Itâ€™s mainly here pastime.
Discovery: Learn how and what to use in situations, Discover the arena and racetracks and shortcuts.  

  
**Mechanics:**
- Movement.
- Speed of vacuum and dog.
- Boosting.
- Physics objects.
<br> 


## Style
Art: Lowpoly, brightly coloured, simplistic.

### Moodboard:

### Colour palette:
![Colours](./Assets/ColourVacuumPalette.png)
<br>

### Map design:
**Style**: Crowded.  
**Make interesting**: Physics object placement, Shortcuts.  
**Planned route**: Start upstairs, run through the bedroom > hallway > Stairs > Kitchen > Living room > Hallway to front door > Front garden > outside garder (win).  
**Shortcuts**: 
- bedroom to stairs (corner skip) by jumping through a hole.
- Stair to living room by jumping through vent.

**Vacuum on shortcuts**: If a player takes a shortcut, speed up or teleport.  

**Level design lookout**: Make doors glow, obstruct shortcuts but make them visible by giving them a certain style of placement (must seem a bit off, like skewed). Check colour of objects, make similar use objects have a defined colour so that the player sees that a physics object is a physics object faster.
