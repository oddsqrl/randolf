## general
<h4 style="color: rgb(190, 190, 190);">Concept</h4>

You play from a dogs point of view. A roomba takes over an old style vacuum cleaner and begins chasing you. There is only one way out of the building to safety and there are various hurdles in the way.

You die on collision with the vacuum cleaner, got a limited amount of boost which slowly regenerates after not using it. Got a few physics objects you can push through for shortcuts but it's not necessary.

The story is that the roomba is killing you... that's it. Story writing :cool
