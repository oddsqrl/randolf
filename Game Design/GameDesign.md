## general
<h4 style="color: rgb(190, 190, 190);">Concept</h4>

You play from a dogs point of view. A roomba takes over an old style vacuum cleaner and begins chasing you. There is only one way out of the building to safety and there are various hurdles in the way.

You die on collision with the vacuum cleaner, got a limited amount of boost which slowly regenerates after not using it. Got a few physics objects you can push through for shortcuts but it's not necessary.

The story is that the roomba is killing you... that's it. Story writing :cool

<h4 style="color: rgb(190, 190, 190);">Scope</h4>

This includes:
- An Unity Engine based game.
- Some low poly art.
- Prototype music.

This doesn't include:
- Professional grade art.
- Professional grade sound design.

Needed for this project:
- One Developer with interest in Art, Sound design, Music.
- A PC capable of running [Unity](https://unity.com), [Blender](https://blender.org/) and a wanted DAW (Likely [FL Studio](https://image-line.com) or [Ableton](https://ableton.com) as they are the market standerd).
- A fitting IDE (integrated development environment) for coding purposes. Likely Jetbrains [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- A PC capable of making a game build.
- Free range for experimentation with level design, features and pacing.

## MDA:
**Aesthetics:**
- Challenge.
- Submission .
- Discovery.

**Dynamics:**  
Challenge: Against other players and working with what you get.  
Submission: It is a game for hectic chaos which is meant to be fun. Itâ€™s mainly here pastime.
Discovery: Learn how and what to use in situations, Discover the arena and racetracks and shortcuts.  

  
**Mechanics:**
- Movement.
- Speed of vacuum and dog.
- Boosting.
- Physics objects.

Loading screen (unused):
The half cut sides slide in from their respective side, goes into loading mode. 
The small circle in the center fills with the amount of completion. 
When done loading the level it slides open again and enables the character movement.

## Game-flowchart:
If there is a split and one of the arrows is grey:
The light gray arrow takes priority, the other arrow would be a could have, but is not a must have for the wanted experience.

## Code-Structure
Using Unity C# and fitting libraries (for UI, Input System, etc).
Using Unity C# as it is a small, low poly game and since I have experience working with it.
Not using Unity ECS as I don't need networking nor do I need the optimisations for this project.

Physics handled by Unity RigidBody for simplicity purposes.

**Unity packages**:
Input System
NavMesh
Cinemachine
TextMeshPro
ProBuilder

<h4 style="color: rgb(190, 190, 190);">Classes</h4>
**AIMovement.cs**:
Has the navmesh of the level on it.
Has the dog (target) transform/location on it.
Moves the AI accordingly by setting a point on the map closest to the target.

**PlayerMovement.cs**:
Handles the player movement.
